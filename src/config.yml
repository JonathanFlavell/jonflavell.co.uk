            Selected for an 8 week work experience program which quickly led to a full internship at
            Whisk, a local startup developing a social online recipe web service with matching IOS
            and android applications. Training with Whiskâ€™s development team, I developed a Chrome
            browser plugin to help the data team improve efficiency. During this time I assisted with
            data entry and in my spare time, I helped the development team with front-end web
            development for their admin site using AngularJS and CoffeeScript.
